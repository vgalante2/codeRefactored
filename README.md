## Description

This webpage underwent a reformatting process to meet the user's acceptance criteria regarding their web presence. The code was refined and optimized to more effectively represent search engine optimization for the marketing company, Horiseon.

Comments were strategically placed throughout the code to clearly delineate various sections and their purposes. Overall, the webpage's visual appearance remains largely unchanged from the original code provided for enhancement.
